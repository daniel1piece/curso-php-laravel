To create a model and migration for database table
We use:

php artisan make:model Profile -m

We can list all of the commands for artisan by typing 
on the console:

php artisan list

--
After modifying the migration files, 
We should run:

php artisan migrate

--
After creating the relationships
between models:
php artisan tinker
$user = new User;
